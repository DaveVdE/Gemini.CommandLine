How it works:

YourProgram.exe [TypeName.]MethodName [/option[:value]]...

This will look for the specified method (optionally from the specified type). 
When the method is not static, an instance is created while trying to map the named arguments to the constructor.
When the instance is created, properties that are specified are set. 
The remaining arguments are used to find the correct overload of the method. Methods can have optional arguments, using nullablle (reference or Nullable<T>) types.
Remaining arguments that are not recognized as options can be retrieved by including a parameter of type string[] named 'arguments'.
